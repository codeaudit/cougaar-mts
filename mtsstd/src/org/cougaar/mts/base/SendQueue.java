/**
 * The second station for an outgoing message is a SendQueue.  In theory a
 * given Message Transport subsystem can have multiple SendQueues.
 * For this release we only make one, instantiated as a SendQueueImpl.
 * Either way, the SendQueues are instantiated by a SendQueueFactory,
 * accessible to SendLinkImpl as the internal MTS service
 * <ff>SendQueue</ff>.
 * <p>
 * The <strong>sendMessage</strong> method is used to queue messages
 * in preparation for passing them onto the next station, a Router.
 * Ordinarily this would only be called from a SendLinkImpl.  The
 * processing of queued messages is assumed to take place in its own
 * thread, not the caller's thread.  In other words, sendMessage is
 * the final call in the original client's call sequence.
 * <p>
 * In a system with multiple SendQueues, the <strong>matches</strong>
 * method would be used by the SendQueueFactory to avoid making any
 * particular queue more than once.  
 * <p>
 * The previous stop is SendLink. The next stop is Router.
