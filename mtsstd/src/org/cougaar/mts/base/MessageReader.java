 * This is the first station in the receiver for serializling
 * LinkProtocols.  MessageWriter and MessageReader allow aspect
 * authors to examine and filter the serialized data stream.
 *
 * <p>
 * Aspect implementers must either call the package-access addFilter
 * AttribuedMessage method or use pushValue("Filter", className) to
 * get the MessageWriter and MessageReader delegates to be attached.
 * Each message has the aspect chain built for it and the target's
 * aspect chain is governed by the list as given by the sender.
 * Normally the attribute is added in the DestinationLink's
 * forwardMessage or addAttributes method.
 * <p>
 * The previous stop is MessageWriter on the sending side.
