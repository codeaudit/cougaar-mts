/**
 * The parent class of all Link Protocols. Instantiable subclasses are required
 * to do two things: they must be able to say whether or not they can deal with
 * any particular addresss (addressKnown), and they must be able to supply a
 * DestinationLink instance for any address they can deal with
 * (getDestinationLink). They will also be given the opportunity to "register"
 * clients, if they have any interest in doing so (for instance, an RMI
 * transport might use this as an opportunity to publish an MTImpl for the
 * client on a nameserver).
 * 
 * LinkProtocols are implicitly factories for the creation of DestinationLinks,
 * so the class is declared to extend AspectFactory, in order to allow aspects
 * to be added to the Links. The aspect attachment is handled in each specific
 * transport class.
 * 
 * Finally, LinkProtocols can act as ServiceProviders for protocol-specific
 * services.
