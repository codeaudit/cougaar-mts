/**
 * The fourth station for an outgoing message is a DestinationQueue. In
 * this implementation, the DestinationQueueFactory instantiates one
 * DestinationQueue per destination address and is accessible to
 * certain impl classes as the MTS-internal service
 * DestinationQueueProviderService. 
 * <p>
 * The dispatching thread associated with this queue will send
 * dequeued messages on to the 'best' DestinationLink, handling
 * retries if an exception occurs.
 * <p>
 * The <strong>holdMessage</strong> method is used to queue messages
 * in preparation for passing them onto the next stop, a
 * transport-specific DestinationLink.  Ordinarily this would only be
 * called from a Router.
 * <p>
 * The <strong>matches</strong> method is used by the
 * DestinationQueueFactory to avoid making more than one queue for a
 * given destinationAddress.  
 * <p>
 * The previous station is Router. The next station is DestinationLink.
