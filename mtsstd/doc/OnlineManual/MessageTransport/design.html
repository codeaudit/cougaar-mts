<h2>MTS Design and Architecture</h2>

  <h4>MTS Structural Components</h4>

<p> The core of the MTS is implemented using classical OOP
techniques. The classes are described in more detail in other
sections. The intention of the overall MTS design is that the core
structural components will remain as is, without addition (except for
new Link Protocols) or modification (except for bug fixes).  Rather
than modifying the core to add new behaviors or modify existing ones,
those additions and changes will be implemented as Aspects, described
in more detail in the <a href="aspects.html">Aspects</a> section. </p>
  
<p> The backbone of the MTS consists of a series of interfaces that
define the flow of a message from the source Agent to the destination
Agent, and a collection of Link Protocols that handle the various
kinds of message delivery (e.g.  local, remote-via-RMI,
remote-via-CORBA, email). The flow interfaces are known as
<i>stations</i>, since messages pass through them in a well-defined
order.  The stations and their implementation and factory classes,
along with the Link Protocols and a few key utility classes,
constitute the structural core of the MTS and are described in more
detail in the <a href="stations.html">Stations</a> section</p>

<h4>Packages and organization</h4>

<p> The Message Transport Service remains as service, and as such
should be organized as any other service. To this end, MTS was
refactored in 11.0 into its own module, with its own corresponding
jar, for ease of developer understanding and use, and more easily
facilitates other pluggable messaging options. The logic of the
refactor focused on separation of base MTS implementation from Aspect
code, used by outside developers. What was necessary to core remained,
including the basic MessageTransportService interface. The rest was
refactored into two packages for the standard service, plus another
two for completely new LinkProtocols: </p>


<p><b>org.cougaar.mts.base</b> </p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Aspect-oriented implementation of minimal MTS including stations, data 
      structures and standard Link Protocols</li>
<li>Offers all the hooks for aspects to add adaptivity</li>
<li>Should export NO services at the Node layer, except MessageTransportService 
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>org.cougaar.mts.std</b> </p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Contains extensions, aspects local services and their required data structures</li>
    <li>May export Node-level service</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>org.cougaar.mts.corba</b> </p>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Contains the implementation of the CORBA LinkProtocol</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>org.cougaar.mts.html</b> </p>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Contains the CSI implementations of the HTTP and HTTPS LinkProtocols</li>
  </ul>
