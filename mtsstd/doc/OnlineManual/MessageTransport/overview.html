<h4>Overview </h4>

<p>
The Cougaar Message Transport Service (MTS) is an adaptive
Node-level service that handles all inter-Agent communication in a
Cougaar society. It is componentized and includes adaptive features
that can be selected at run-time. Adaptive features from the Ultra*log
program include: adaptivity to different threat level of society
(BBN), dependability (OBJS), security (NAI), performance (BBN QUO) and
agent-mobility (BBN).</p>

<p> The MTS is organized in classical Object Oriented Programming
(OOP) fashion around a collection of classes that define the
structural components, augmented with a simple implementation of
Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) that facilitates crosscutting among
the structural objects. Together, the OOP and AOP components provide a
simple, robust core that's very easy to adapt and extend. Both the OOP
and AOP components are described below. MTS code was refactored, out
of the core, to allow ease of use and understanding for developers. A
description of this refactoring can be found in <a
href="design.html">Design and Architecure</a>.  </p>


  




<h4>MTS Use of the Thread Service</h4>

<p> All Java Threads used within the MTS are allocated and maintained
by a locally defined ThreadService, a child of the Node-level
ThreadService. All MTS components should get all threads through the
Thread Service.</p>

<p> The MTS makes use of 11.0's &quot;Thread Lanes&quot; Thread
Service implementation by providing 4 context switches: </p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li>SendLink - Agent assigned a thread</li>
    <li>Send Queue - Best Effort</li>
    <li>Destination Queue - Blocks on IO</li>
    <li>ReceiveLink - Receives the LinkProtocol's thread -[RMI has its own, which 
      Cougaar does not control]</li>
  </ul>

<h4>MTS Use of the Cougaar Component Model</h4>

<p> As can be seen from the descriptions, the MTS makes heavy use of
the Cougaar Component Model. The two forms of dynamic extensions,
Aspects and LinkProtocols, are loaded as Components. In addition, many
of the internal objects are defined as Components and use locally
defined Services to communicate with one another.  </p>
