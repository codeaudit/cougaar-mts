<h4>MTS Aspects</h4>

<p> The principles of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) provide a
perfect mechanism for extending and adapting the basic structure of
the MTS, since the nature of such extensions is generally a <i>cut</i>
across two or more structural components. In order to facilitate this
use of AOP without depending on third-party code generators, the MTS
includes a simple, limited implementation directly in Java that uses
aspect instances to provide delegates for the various station
interfaces. This implementation centers on classes, which implement
the interface MessageTransportAspect, in particular, subclasses of
StandardAspect. All the aspects described below are sublcasses of
StandardAspect. Aspects are Cougaar Components and are loaded in the
usual way. Some Aspects are also created explicitly in code. </p>

<p> The application of aspects to station and other instances is
handled by the AspectSupport Service, available to all MTS
Components. The order of aspects is important and will always follow
the Component loading order. The explicitly created aspects always
come before the aspects loaded as Components. </p>

<p> The application of aspects follows a simple pattern, using the
MessageTransportAspect method getDelegate. After any
&quot;aspectizable&quot; instance is created, whether by a factory or
by any other means, each aspect in turn is given an opportunity to
provide a delegate for that instance. The delegate, which will of
course match the same interface as the original instance, will then
take the place of the original instance or the previous delegate in
the application of aspects. The final result is a nested series of
objects matching the original interface whose innermost object is the
original instance. The earlier an aspect appears in the global list of
all aspects, the closer any delegate it provides will be to the raw
instance for which the delegates are being provided. </p>

<p> One extra complication has arisen in the use of aspects. In some
cases, proper nesting of send code with matching receive code requires
that the order of aspects be reversed in the latter. In order to
handle this, aspects are actually given two chances to provide
delegates: once in the original aspect order, then again in the
reversed order. The first opportunity is getAspect, described
above. The second is getReverseAspect. In the second case, later
aspect delegates will be closer the raw instance. </p>

<p> The following interfaces support aspects, in the sense that
instances of these interfaces will always have aspect delegates
attached immediately after instantiation: DestinationLink,
DestinationQueue, MessageDeliverer, NameSupport, Router, SendLink,
SendQueue. In addition, the RMILinkProtocol provides two other places
in which aspects can be attached: the RMI server object; and the
client-side stub for remote MT objects. These two present a problem
for the getDelegate and getReverseDelegate calls, since in both cases
the relevant delegate interface is MT.class. In order to distinguish
these two, we use MTImpl.class in the getDelegate and
getReverseDelegate calls on for the RMI server object, even though the
delegates themselves need only match the interface MT. Finally,
aspect delegates may be attached indirectly to serialization streams,
which has the effect of converting a direct tcp connection into a
series of Filter Streams (see org.cougaar.core.mts.MessageWriter and
org.cougaar.core.mts.MessageReader).</p>

<p> Since most aspect delegates only want to provide a few methods of
the given interface, rather than a complete reimplementation, we
provide trivial delegating implementations for each of the station
interfaces. In all cases, the names have the form {interface}
DelegateImplBase. The aspect delegate classes should extend these and
only have to provide the methods that are relevant to that
aspect. </p>

<p> Here is a partial list of aspects in the Core MTS. The following
figure depicts a few aspects and where they get attached to the
message stations.</p>

<p class=MsoCaption>Figure: Message Transport 
    Aspects Cross Cut Multiple Stations</p>

<h5>AgentStatusAspect</h5>

<p>Collects Agent State information.</p>

<h5>DeliveryVerificationAspect</h5>

<p> Logs warnings if a message has been pending for too long.(default
is 10 seconds) </p>

<h5>MessageProtectionAspect</h5>

<p> Provides an example of adding trailers to serialized
AttributedMessages.  Stores a message attribute reflecting the
validity of the message bytecount.</p>

<h5>MessageSendTimeAspect</h5>

<p>Tags all messages with a &quot;send time&quot; attribute when they enter 
    the MTS SendLink.</p>

<h5>MessageTimeoutAspect</h5>

<p> Aspect to throw out a timed out message. Necessary for MsgLog
et. al. Checks every thread in MTS for timed out attributes on a
message: SendLink, Router, DestinationLink, ReceiveLink</p>

<h5>MessageTraceAspect</h5>

<p> Debugging and testing Aspect - logs a successful or failed message
entry per stage of the MTS. This entry contains useful information
about the message as well as time deltas between stages. Use BBN
Adaptive Robustness's csmart/rules/debug_rules/messageTrace.rule.  Or,
simply configure the society configuration to include the
MessageSendTimeAspect, MessageProtectionAspect, and the
MessageTraceAspect along with this argument: </p>

<pre>   -Dorg.cougaar.core.logging.log4j.appender.MessageTrace.File = #{cip}/workspace/log4jlogs/#{node.name}.trace</pre>

<h5>RMISocketControlAspect</h5>

<p>This aspect adds simple statistics gathering to the client side OutputStream 
    of RMI connections.</p>

<h5>WatcherAspect</h5>

<p>Implements the message watching functionality by attaching delegates to SendQueue 
    and MessageDeliverer objects.</p>

<h5>MulticastAspect</h5>

<p>Multicast in the MTS is handled by this aspect.</p>


<h5>ForwardMessageLoggingAspect</h5>

<p>Logs interesting fields of received messages, in tab-separated format; used 
    for debugging Link Protocols</p>

<h5>SecurityAspect</h5>

<p>Provides a simple form of message-level security by enabling message signing. 
    This is more of an example than a functional aspect.</p>

<h5>SerializationAspect</h5>

<p>Forces the LoopbackLinkProtocol to serialize all messages; used to debug 
    serialization error.</p>

<h5>StatisticsAspect</h5>

<p>Collects message transport statistics. This is used by the metric services 
    PSP.</p>

<h5>TraceAspect</h5>

<p>Logs data about messages as they move through the message transport
stations.  This is used for debugging the message transport.</p>

<h5>ScrambleAspect</h5>

<p>Scrambles a message sequence; used to debug message transport.</p>

<h5>SequenceAspect</h5>

<p>Ensures that messages are delivered in right sequence.</p>

<h5>StubDumperAspect</h5>

<p>Displays information about LinkProtocol addresses; used to debug LinkProtocols.</p>

<h5>StepperAspect</h5>

<p>Provides a gui for &quot;single-stepping&quot; the sending of messages.</p>

<h5>ChecksumStreamsAspect</h5>

<p>An example of using FilterStreams in RMI. This particular example adds 
    a checksum to the end of the message. Adding trailers onto message serialization 
    could also be used to sign a message.</p>

<h5>CompressingStreamsAspect</h5>

<p>Another example of using FilterStreams in RMI. This example compresses 
    and decompresses message data on the fly.</p>


<h4>AOP is Not a Magic Bullet</h4>

<p> By combining OOP and AOP, a simple and easily maintainable core
design for message transport can be easily extended, either to provide
new sorts of behavior altogether (e.g., new ,) or to adapt existing
behavior in smart and dynamic ways (e.g. new Aspects), without
compromising the simplicity of the core design.  This is a significant
win in every way. But the use of AOP in the MTS design is not a magic
bullet: it won't eliminate every design problem that might ever arise,
even if it greatly reduces the overall complexity. </p>

<p> In particular, considerable care is required when combining
Aspects in previously untested ways. Aspects should usually be
orthogonal to one another, and most of the current Aspects are. But
even in this case, Aspect order can be very important. The user of a
given set of Aspects needs to understand them well enough to choose a
reasonable order at runtime. </p>

<p> When Aspects are not orthogonal, the interactions will of course
become even trickier to handle properly (though not remotely as
complicated as managing the same interactions would be in a monolithic
design). In such situations, the lack of orthogonality needs to be
examined very closly, since it may simply be an artifact of confused
Aspect design. Non-orthogonal Aspects should be quite unusual, and as
such can reasonably be expected to require special-case handling. </p>
