<h4>MTS Station backbone</h4>

 <p>The basic stations are described below figure and also depicted 
    in the &quot;top view&quot; diagram.</p>

    enumerates all the Message Stations. </p>

  
 <p> When a message is sent from the sending Agent to the receiving
  Agent, it flows through a predefined series of stations, described
  below in the &quot;side view&quot; of the Services (see Figure
  below). A message flows from the sending Agent through a per-Agent
  Send Link, associated with the Agent's Message Transport Service
  Proxy, into a shared Send Queue. The act of dropping the message in
  the Send Queue terminates the invoking call. The Send Queue's
  dedicated thread then passes the each message to the Router, which
  picks a Destination Queue for that message. Each Destination Queue
  has its own thread and is responsible for delivering messages to the
  corresponding receiving Agent, even if that Agents isn't active at
  the time. The Destination Queues select the &quot;best&quot;
  LinkProtocol for each message and hand it off to a DestinationLink
  created by the LinkProtocol. The Destination Link then moves the
  message to the MessageDeliverer on the destination Node, using the
  given protocol (eg RMI, email, nttp, loopback, CORBA, or raw
  sockets). The MessageDeliverer finds the corresponding ReceiveLink
  for the message, which in turn hands the message off to the
  destination Agent.  If the receiving Agent is no longer local, the
  MessageDeliverer will throw an exception back to the
  DestinationQueue in the sending Node</p>

 <h5>MessageTransportService </h5>

 <p> This interface specifies the Service itself, as seen by the
Agent. The implementation class is MessageTransportServiceProxy,
exactly one of which is created for each Agent which requests the
MessageTransportService. The MessageTransportServiceProvider makes
MessageTransportServiceProxy instances on demand. The implementation
class does very little work itself. Most of the work is handled by a
SendLinkImpl, which is created for the MessageTransportServiceProxy by
the MessageTransportServiceProvider.  </p>

<h5>SendLink </h5>

<p>
This is the first functional MTS station. The SendLink handles
client registration, decides whether or not a given message can be
sent, and in most circumstances starts the message on its way by
placing it on the SendQueue. In ordinary message traffic, the calling
thread of a message-send operation returns once the SendLink has
placed the message on the SendQueue. SendLinkImpl, one of which is
made for each MessageTransportServiceProxy by the
MessageTransportServiceProvider, implements SendLink. </p>

<h5>SendQueue </h5>

<p> The SendQueue has two purposes: it keeps messages in order, and it
prevents the calling thread of the sending Agent from blocking. As
such the queue itself is simply a holding place for
messages. SendQueueImpl, instances of which are created by the
SendQueueFactory, implements the SendQueue interface. In the current
design, SendQueueFactory is ServiceProvider for the SendQueue
service. SendQueueImpl is a sublcass of MessageQueue and as such has
an associated thread. In this case the thread pulls Messages off the
queue and forwards them to the Router. </p>

<h5>Router </h5>

<p> The Router has the job of sorting Messages by target (destination)
and passing them to the corresponding DestinationQueue for that
target. It uses the DestinationQueueProviderService, which will find
or make at most one DestinationQueue for any given target.
RouterImpl, instances of which are created by the RouterFactory,
implements the Router interface. In the current design, RouterFactory
is a ServiceProvider for the Router service. </p>

<h5>DestinationQueue </h5>

<p> The DestinationQueues have the job of selecting the
&quot;best&quot; LinkProtocol for any given message, and delivering
the message, in the correct order, to a DestinationLink provided by
that LinkProtocol. The selection itself is handled indirectly, via the
LinkSelectionPolicy (see below). DestinationQueueImpl, instances of
which are created by the DestinationQueueFactory, implements the
DestinationQueue interface. One DestinationQueueImpl is made for each
referenced destination MessageAddress by the
DestinationQueueProviderService.  DestinationQueueImpl is a subclass
of MessageQueue and as such has an associated thread. In this case the
thread pulls Messages off the queue and attempts to dispatch them to a
DestinationLink, which can deliver them. For any given Message these
attempts will continue until the Message is successfully delivered.
</p>

<h5>DestinationLink </h5>

<p> DestinationLinks do the protocol-specific work of getting the
message from the sender's Node to the receiver's Node. The
DestinationLink implementation classes are specific to their
corresponding LinkProtocol and are typically defined as inner classes
of the protocol classes. See the LinkProtocol section for more
details. </p>

  <h5>MessageDeliverer </h5>

<p> The MessageDeliverer has the job of finding the right ReceiveLink
for each Message, and passing the Message off to that link once it's
been found. MessageDeliverer is an MTS-level service, provided by the
MessageDelivererFactory and implemented in the current design by a
singleton MessageDelivererImpl instance. </p>

<h5>ReceiveLink </h5>

<p> ReceiveLinks simply accept Messages from the MessageDeliverer and
hands them off to the ultimate recipient. ReceiveLinkImpl, instances
of which are created by the ReceiveLinkFactory, implements the
ReceiveLink interface. The MessageTransportRegistryService makes
requests for instantiation on demand via the
ReceiveLinkProviderService.  </p>

<h5>Link Protocols</h5>

<p> As the side-view diagram  makes clear, message flow is
divided into two parts, send and receive, with the linkage between the
two left unspecified. There are a number of ways in which this linkage
might be handled: it could be direct (for local messages), it could
use an RMI or CORBA call, it could use email or news, it could use
sockets, etc. The MTS implements these various kinds of linkages as
instantiable subclasses of the abstract class LinkProtocol. These
instantiable subclasses have full responsibility for getting a Message
from the sender's Node to the receiver's Node. Some of these Link
Protocols are part of the Cougaar 'core' module, some are from other
modules supported by BBN, and some are from other developers. The
BBN-supported Link Protocols are described here. Defining new
LinkProtocol classes is one of two primary hooks through which the MTS
can be extended (aspects are the other).</p>

<p> Link Protocols are connected to the message flow by the
DestinationLink station.  DestinationLinks can be thought of as
destination-specific front ends to Link Protocols and are ordinarily
defined as inner classes of LinkProtocol classes.  The protocol itself
is responsible for the real work of moving Messages, and also acts as
the &quot;factory&quot; for its DestinationLinks.</p>

<p>For more details see <a href="linkprotocols.html>Link Protocols</a>.

<h5>Link Selection Policy</h5>

<p> When more than one LinkProtocol is defined, the DestinationQueues
need to pick one for each queued Message. The LinkSelectionPolicy, a
service created by the MessageTransportServiceProvider, handles the
job of selecting the best protocol for any given message. The default
implementation class for this interface is
MinCostLinkSelectionPolicy.  Loading another implementation overrides
this default.</p>

<p> The MinCostLinkSelectionPolicy does what its name implies: it
selects the cheapest DestinationLink. The DestinationLinks, in turn,
compute a cost by asking their enclosing LinkProtocol class. </p>

<h5>Naming and Registration </h5>

<p> Two forms of name registration are managed by the MTS. One, the
MessageTransportRegistryService, handles local Agent registration by
keeping a map from Agent addresses to the Agent's ReceiveLink
representation. This simple map is used in the final step of Message
delivery. The NameSupport Service represents the second naming class
in the MTS. NameSupport provides a high-level front-end to the basic
Cougaar naming services (eg WhitePages). NameSupport and
MessageTransportRegistryService are available as Services to all MTS
Components. </p>
